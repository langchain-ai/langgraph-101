            "- A low-level orchestration framework designed for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents and workflows\n",
            "- Built on top of LangChain to improve creation of cyclical graphs needed for agent runtimes\n",
            "- Combines large language models (LLMs) with graph-based architectures for more structured AI workflows\n",
            "\n",
            "### **Core Concepts**\n",
            "- **Graph-based structure**: Workflows are organized as interconnected nodes and edges, where each node represents a task or processing step\n",
            "- **State management**: Maintains state throughout agent execution with annotated state definitions\n",
            "- **Modularity**: Developers can create reusable components and combine multiple nodes into powerful, dynamic AI processes\n",

            "- Simple chatbots\n",
            "- Complex multi-agent systems\n",

            "- Agent-based AI applications requiring sophisticated control flow\n",
            "\n",
            "### **Key Features**\n",
            "- Transparent, developer-friendly design for building advanced AI systems\n",
            "- Scalable architecture for handling complex agent interactions\n",
            "- Integration with LangChain products and tools\n",
            "- Visual prototyping capabilities through LangGraph Studio\n",
            "- Widely adopted by companies like Klarna, Replit, and Elastic\n",
