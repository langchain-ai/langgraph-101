      "LangChain is an open‑source framework for building applications that use large language models (LLMs). It provides the building blocks you need to connect LLMs to data, tools, and multi-step workflows, so you can create robust AI assistants, chatbots, and automation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key ideas and components:\n",
      "- Chains: sequences of prompts and LLM calls to perform multi-step reasoning.\n",
      "- Prompt templates: reusable prompts that plug in variables.\n",
      "- Agents and tools: agents decide actions and can call external tools or APIs (e.g., search, calculators, code execution, database queries).\n",
      "- Memory: store and reuse context from previous interactions (conversation history, summaries).\n",
      "- Vector stores: manage embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over documents or data sources.\n",
      "- Prompts, callbacks, and evaluation: structured ways to manage prompts, track events, and assess outputs.\n",
      "- Language support: LangChain has Python and JavaScript/TypeScript versions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Typical use cases:\n",
      "- Chatbots and virtual assistants\n",
      "- Question answering over documents or the web\n",
      "- Automating workflows that require planning and tool use\n",
      "- RAG pipelines combining LLMs with external data sources\n",
      "- Code generation, QA, and data extraction tasks\n",

    "\n",
    "We've been using `create_agent()`, which is built on **LangGraph**. LangGraph gives you full control over agent behavior using three core primitives:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core LangGraph Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State** \n",
    "   - Shared data structure passed between nodes\n",
    "   - Represents the agent's \"memory\"\n",
    "   - Can include messages, custom data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** \n",
    "   - Python functions that process state\n",
    "   - Each node performs a specific task\n",
    "   - Examples: call LLM, execute tool, validate input\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edges** \n",
    "   - Define flow between nodes\n",
    "   - Can be normal (always go to next node)\n",
    "   - Or conditional (decide based on logic)"
