      "LangChain is an open-source framework for building AI-powered applications that use large language models (LLMs). It doesn’t provide a model itself; instead it offers tools to structure and manage how you interact with LLMs and external data or actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key ideas:\n",
      "- Chains: compose a sequence of steps (prompts, LLM calls, data processing) so outputs feed into the next step.\n",
      "- Prompts and templates: reusable prompt formats with variables.\n",
      "- Memory: keep context across interactions (e.g., conversation history).\n",
      "- Tools and agents: let the model decide to call external tools (search, code execution, databases, calculators, etc.) to perform tasks.\n",
      "- Retrieval and data sources: connect to vector stores and document loaders to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.\n",
      "- Integrations: supports multiple backends (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, etc.) and, in addition to Python, has a JavaScript/TypeScript version.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common use cases:\n",
      "- Chatbots that reference a knowledge base\n",
      "- Question-answering with document retrieval\n",
      "- Code assistants or data analysis that run external tools\n",
      "- Automated workflows that require multi-step reasoning\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting started (high level):\n",
      "- Install (Python): pip install langchain (or npm install langchain for JS/TS)\n",
      "- Create a simple chain that prompts an LLM for a response\n",
      "- Extend with memory, tools, or vector stores as needed\n",
      "\n",
      "Example snippet (Python, simplified):\n",
      "- from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate\n",
      "- template = \"You are a helpful assistant. Question: {question}\"\n",

      "    - Start at (1,1) with battery 50.\n",
      "  - Step 1:\n",
      "    - Percept: no dirt here, battery 50.\n",
      "    - Action: move East to (1,2).\n",
      "  - Step 2:\n",
      "    - Percept: no dirt here, battery 49.\n",
      "    - Action: move East to (1,3).\n",
      "  - Step 3:\n",
      "    - Percept: no dirt here, battery 48.\n",

      "    - If there were more dirt, it would move toward the next one; otherwise it might return to dock to recharge if the battery gets low.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **State** \n",
    "   - Shared data structure passed between nodes\n",
    "   - Represents the agent's \"memory\"\n",
    "   - Can include messages, custom data, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nodes** \n",
    "   - Python functions that process state\n",
    "   - Each node performs a specific task\n",
    "   - Examples: call LLM, execute tool, validate input\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Edges** \n",
    "   - Define flow between nodes\n",
    "   - Can be normal (always go to next node)\n",
    "   - Or conditional (decide based on logic)"
