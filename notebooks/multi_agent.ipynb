    "**Evaluations** are a quantitative way to measure performance of agents, which is important beacause LLMs don't always behave precitably — small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare changes across different versions of your applicaiton, and build more reliable AI applications.\n",

    "1. A **dataset test** inputs and expected outputs.\n",
    "2. An **application or target function** that defines what you are evaluating, taking in inputs and returning the application output\n",
