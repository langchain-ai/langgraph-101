    "\n",
    "There is another popular framework for building multi-agent graphs called Swarm. At LangChain, we built a [lightweight library](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-swarm-py) to help make Swarm agents very easily! Swarm agents are designed for collaborative problem-solving where multiple specialized agents work together, without a central coordinator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Swarm vs Supervisor\n",
    "\n",
    "![swarm_vs_supervisor](../images/supervisor_vs_swarm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarm architecture differs from supervisor-based approaches by emphasizing decentralized collaboration rather than hierarchical control. In a supervisor architecture, a central agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks, and makes decisions about which subagents to call. This creates a clear hierarchy where the supervisor has authority over specialized agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervisor approach offers more control and predictability, while swarm architectures can be more adaptable and resilient to individual agent failures. Your choice between these approaches depends on whether your use case benefits more from centralized oversight or emergent collaboration.\n",
