Effective prompt design can significantly enhance the relevance, accuracy, and utility of the model\\'s outputs. Here are some best practices to consider:\\n\\n**1. Clarity and Specificity**\\n\\nCraft prompts that are clear and specific to guide the model toward the desired response. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to inconsistent or irrelevant outputs. For example:\\n\\n- **Vague Prompt:** \"Tell me about tides.\"\\n- **Specific Prompt:** \"What are the high tide times in Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on March 31, 2025?\"\\n\\nThe specific prompt provides clear parameters, leading to a more accurate and relevant response. ([techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Prompt-engineering-tips-and-best-practices?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**2. Contextual Framing**\\n\\nProviding context within your prompt helps the model understand the background and nuances of the request. This can include specifying the role the model should assume or the perspective it should adopt. For instance:\\n\\n- **Without Context:** \"Explain blockchain.\"\\n- **With Context:** \"As a blockchain expert, explain the concept of blockchain and its potential use cases in supply chain management.\"\\n\\nAssigning a persona or role can significantly improve the relevance and depth of the model\\'s response. ([roboticsbiz.com](https://roboticsbiz.com/a-guide-to-prompt-engineering-enhancing-the-performance-of-large-language-models-llms/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**3. Incorporate Examples**\\n\\nIncluding examples in your prompts can guide the model toward the desired output format and content. This technique, known as few-shot prompting, provides the model with patterns to emulate. For example:\\n\\n- **Prompt with Example:** \"Translate the following English sentences into French. Example: \\'Hello, how are you?\\' translates to \\'Bonjour, comment ça va?\\'. Now, translate: \\'Good morning, have a nice day.\\'\"\\n\\nProviding examples helps the model understand the task requirements more effectively. ([sandgarden.com](https://www.sandgarden.com/learn/prompt-engineering?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**4. Use Action-Oriented Language**\\n\\nEmploying action-oriented verbs in your prompts can direct the model to perform specific tasks. This approach clarifies the expected action and outcome. For example:\\n\\n- **Action-Oriented Prompt:** \"Generate five potential business ideas for an AI-based startup.\"\\n\\nThis prompt clearly instructs the model to create a list of ideas, leading to a focused response. ([roboticsbiz.com](https://roboticsbiz.com/a-guide-to-prompt-engineering-enhancing-the-performance-of-large-language-models-llms/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**5. Iterative Refinement**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is often an iterative process. Testing and refining prompts based on the model\\'s outputs can lead to improved performance. Start with a basic prompt and adjust it as needed to achieve the desired results. ([roboticsbiz.com](https://roboticsbiz.com/a-guide-to-prompt-engineering-enhancing-the-performance-of-large-language-models-llms/?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**6. Model-Specific Optimization**\\n\\nDifferent LLMs may respond differently to the same prompt. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the specific model you\\'re working with can inform prompt design. Tailoring prompts to the model\\'s capabilities can enhance performance. ([fenilsonani.com](https://fenilsonani.com/articles/prompt-engineering-llms-best-practices?utm_source=openai))\\n\\n**7. Security Considerations**\\n\\nBe aware of potential security risks, such as prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs can manipulate the model\\'s behavior.

      "[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Prompt engineering is a critical practice for optimizing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). Effective prompt design can significantly enhance the relevance, accuracy, and utility of the model\\'s outputs. Here are some best practices to consider:\\n\\n**1. Clarity and Specificity**\\n\\nCraft prompts that are clear and specific to guide the model toward the desired response. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to inconsistent or irrelevant outputs. For example:\\n\\n- **Vague Prompt:** \"Tell me about tides.\"\\n- **Specific Prompt:** \"What are the high tide times in Gloucester Harbor, Massachusetts, on March 31, 2025?\"\\n\\nThe specific prompt provides clear parameters, leading to a more accurate and relevant response. [1]\\n\\n**2. Contextual Framing**\\n\\nProviding context within your prompt helps the model understand the background and nuances of the request. This can include specifying the role the model should assume or the perspective it should adopt. For instance:\\n\\n- **Without Context:** \"Explain blockchain.\"\\n- **With Context:** \"As a blockchain expert, explain the concept of blockchain and its potential use cases in supply chain management.\"\\n\\nAssigning a persona or role can significantly improve the relevance and depth of the model\\'s response. [2]\\n\\n**3. Incorporate Examples**\\n\\nIncluding examples in your prompts can guide the model toward the desired output format and content. This technique, known as few-shot prompting, provides the model with patterns to emulate. For example:\\n\\n- **Prompt with Example:** \"Translate the following English sentences into French. Example: \\'Hello, how are you?\\' translates to \\'Bonjour, comment ça va?\\'. Now, translate: \\'Good morning, have a nice day.\\'\"\\n\\nProviding examples helps the model understand the task requirements more effectively. [3]\\n\\n**4. Use Action-Oriented Language**\\n\\nEmploying action-oriented verbs in your prompts can direct the model to perform specific tasks. This approach clarifies the expected action and outcome. For example:\\n\\n- **Action-Oriented Prompt:** \"Generate five potential business ideas for an AI-based startup.\"\\n\\nThis prompt clearly instructs the model to create a list of ideas, leading to a focused response. [2]\\n\\n**5. Iterative Refinement**\\n\\nPrompt engineering is often an iterative process. Testing and refining prompts based on the model\\'s outputs can lead to improved performance. Start with a basic prompt and adjust it as needed to achieve the desired results. [2]\\n\\n**6. Model-Specific Optimization**\\n\\nDifferent LLMs may respond differently to the same prompt. Understanding the strengths and limitations of the specific model you\\'re working with can inform prompt design. Tailoring prompts to the model\\'s capabilities can enhance performance. [4]\\n\\n**7. Security Considerations**\\n\\nBe aware of potential security risks, such as prompt injection attacks, where malicious inputs can manipulate the model\\'s behavior. Implementing input validation and monitoring outputs can help mitigate these risks. [5]\\n\\nBuilding upon foundational prompt engineering practices, recent advancements have introduced sophisticated techniques to further enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). Here are some notable developments:\\n\\n**1.

      "[{'type': 'text', 'text': '# Best Practices for Informed Decision Making: Principles and Authoritative Resources\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nFacing choices where specific context is unknown—such as when instructed to “use your best judgement”—calls for robust, adaptable decision-making frameworks. Whether the scenario is professional, personal, or organizational, the core principles remain remarkably consistent: clarify the problem, think critically, analyze risks, consider ethics, develop alternatives, and learn from outcomes. This report synthesizes the leading best practices for sound judgement in any context, and offers a curated list of foundational and cutting-edge resources so you can apply these methods broadly and deeply.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## General Best Practices for Robust Decision Making\\n\\n### 1. Define the Problem Clearly\\n\\n- **Identify the Decision Context:** Precisely articulate what decision needs to be made. Avoid ambiguity by explicitly stating the issue.  \\n- **Gather Relevant Information:** Seek out both quantitative data (metrics, statistics) and qualitative inputs (observations, opinions) relevant to the problem. This comprehensive approach equips you to make informed choices.  \\n  - _Reference: [Critical Thinking: What Is It, Why Is It Important, and How Do You Develop It?](https://northwest.education/insights/executive-education/what-is-critical-thinking/?utm_source=openai)_\\n\\n### 2. Apply Critical Thinking\\n\\n- **Analyze Assumptions and Biases:** Acknowledge your assumptions and watch for cognitive biases (e.g., confirmation bias, availability heuristic), which can inadvertently shape conclusions.\\n- **Evaluate Evidence Objectively:** Rigorously assess the credibility, accuracy, and reliability of the information at hand. Differentiate between facts, interpretations, and untested assumptions.\\n\\n### 3. Conduct Risk Analysis\\n\\n- **Identify and Assess Risks:** List potential risks or negative outcomes for each option. Evaluate both likelihood and severity to prioritize attention.\\n- **Reference Standards:** Frameworks like [ISO 31000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31000?utm_source=openai) provide structured guidelines for identifying, analyzing, and managing risks.\\n- **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Formulate ways to minimize the likelihood or impact of high-priority risks.\\n\\n### 4. Incorporate Ethical Considerations\\n\\n- **Identify Ethical Principles:** Clarify which moral values (honesty, fairness, respect) apply to the context.\\n- **Evaluate with Ethical Frameworks:** Use frameworks such as utilitarianism (maximizing overall benefit), deontology (adherence to rules), and virtue ethics (prioritizing character traits).\\n- **Stakeholder Impact:** Consider how each decision will affect all people or groups involved.  \\n  - _Reference: [Ethical Decision Making](https://www.caalley.com/icaipub/misc/82307psec66392.pdf?utm_source=openai)_\\n\\n### 5. Generate and Evaluate Alternatives\\n\\n- **Develop Options:** Avoid settling on the first idea—brainstorm a range of alternatives to broaden your perspective.\\n- **Weigh Pros and Cons:** Assess the relative benefits and drawbacks of each choice considering critical, risk, and ethical factors.\\n\\n### 6. Select and Implement the Best Option\\n\\n- **Make the Decision:** Choose the alternative that best aligns with your analysis and core values.\\n- **Document the Process:** Record how and why you arrived at your conclusion, ensuring accountability and transparency.\\n\\n### 7.
