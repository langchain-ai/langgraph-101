    "- `user`: The simulated user. Must accept the current trajectory as a list of messages as an input arg and kwargs for thread_id and turn_counter. Should accept other kwargs as more may be added in future releases. Returns a chat message as output. May also be a list of string or message responses.\n",
    "- `max_turns`/`maxTurns`: The maximum number of conversation turns to simulate.\n",
    "- `stopping_condition`/`stoppingCondition`: Optional callable that determines if the simulation should end early. Takes the current trajectory as a list of messages as an input arg and a kwarg named turn_counter, and should return a boolean. We will showing an example of this implementation today!\n",
