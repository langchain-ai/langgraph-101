    "**Evaluations** are a quantitative way to measure performance of agents, which is important beacause LLMs don't always behave precitably — small changes in prompts, models, or inputs can significantly impact results. Evaluations provide a structured way to identify failures, compare changes across different versions of your applicaiton, and build more reliable AI applications.\n",
